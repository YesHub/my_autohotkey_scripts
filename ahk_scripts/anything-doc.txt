If you use GNU/Emacs  maybe you have known "Anything"
maybe not , 
you can visit "Anything" on emacswiki 
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Anything 
and see what "Anything" it is .

and this isn't anything.el ,it 's anything.ahk

you can input search string just like google to narrow the candidates

Down or Ctrl+n          select next candidate 
Up or Ctrl+p            select previous candidate
Ctrl+o                  will select next source ,that means ,all candidate from first source will be send to last 
pageUp ,Ctrl-r ,Alt-v -->pageup
pageDn ,Ctrl-v       --> pageDn
when you select a candidate you can press

<Click>and  <Enter>     to execute the default action with the selected candiate as parameter
<Ctrl-j>                to execute the second action with the selected candidate as parameter
<Ctrl-m>                to execute the third action with the selected candidate as parameter

<Ctrl-z>                  same to <Enter> ,but don't quit "Anything"
<Alt-Enter>               do the same to Enter ,but doesn't quit "Anything"
<Alt-j>                   do the same to Ctrl-j ,but doesn't quit "Anything"
<Alt-m>                   do the same to Ctrl-m ,but doesn't quit "Anything"

<tab>                   will list all available actions , and you can select one to execute .
<Ctrl-l>                will ignore all the candidates ,and treate the search string as candidate , and
                        list all available "action" to execute on the special "candidate"
<Ctrl-i>                do something similar to <Ctrl-l> ,but don't list all available "action" ,just
                        execute the "action" special by "property"
                        anything_properties["no_candidate_action"]:="anything_do_nothing"
                        ;; anything_with_properties()
                        ;; anything_multiple_sources_with_properties()
<Esc> and <Ctrl-g>      quit Anything

Ctrl-u                  empty search string
backspace and Ctrl-h   back delete a char
Ctrl-y                 paste



Now I have wrote 3 <source> for anything.ahk
    anything-explorer-history.ahk ,
    anything-favorite-directories.ahk,
    anything-run.ahk

1 anything-explorer-history.ahk
when you visit new directory (double click on a directory,up ,back ) in explorer.exe ,it can record directories 
you have visited ,then you can press  <F3> to active "Anything"

and you can press <F3> to active "Anything" and list all directory history


2 anything-run.ahk is a replace of <Win-r>
 it could remember old  command too. when you press <F3>
 
3 anything-favorite-directories.ahk  do something like anything-explorer-history.ahk
 add your favorite directories ,and visit it using "Anything"

 you just need download
 
 anything.ahk
 anything-explorer-history.ahk
 anything-favorite-directories.ahk
 anything-run.ahk
 anything-config.ahk

 
 and run anything-config.ahk
